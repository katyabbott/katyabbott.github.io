Sea level anomaly near Bermuda
======

This is a video of sea level anomaly (SLA) near Bermuda from the years 2002 to 2004, made by high school interns in the [BridgeUP: STEM Brown Scholars](https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/teens/brown-scholars) program at the American Museum of Natural History. Throughout the last year, they have been using satellite SLA data to study the formation of mesoscale eddies and identify them using a computer algorithm. From this video, several trends were identified: 
- Eddies in the Bermuda region moved west
- Hot, anticyclonic eddies were more likely to be present during the winter months near Bermuda (November to March)
- Cold, cyclonic eddies were more likely to be found during the summer months near Bermuda (May to October)
- The more symmetrical and/or circular an eddy was, the longer the eddy would last
