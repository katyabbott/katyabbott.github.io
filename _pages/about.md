I am currently a PhD student in physical oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography. I'm interested in studying biophysical interactions with a variety of tools, including observations, satellite data and models. <br/> <br/>
Previously, I worked as a GIS technician at Big Bend National Park in Texas, where I made maps for the park. During my time there, I developed a [set of tools](https://bigbendnp.github.io/nightskyquality/) for mapping night-sky quality, and produced a data visualization of night skies in the Big Bend region, which you can view [here](https://bigbendnp.github.io/nightskyquality/pages/nightskyviz.html). <br/> <br/>
I was also a Helen Fellow at the American Museum of Natural History, working on a project to study how mesoscale eddies modulate sea-surface carbon in the Sargasso Sea. Before that, I served as an AmeriCorps member at the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in Santa Rosa, California, which sparked my interest in computational science. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2017 with degrees in geophysics and applied mathematics. At UC Berkeley, I worked on research projects to model submarine volcanic flow fronts and study the relationship between water supply and wildfire in Yosemite. My research interests include carbon cycling, machine learning and remote sensing.

In my free time, I bake bread, brew my own kombucha, and go for long hikes in national parks.
