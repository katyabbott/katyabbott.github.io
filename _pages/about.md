I am currently a GIS technician at Big Bend National Park in Texas, where I make maps for the park and work on different research projects, such as visualizing nighttime radiance in one of the darkest places in the lower 48. Big Bend is rural â€” I live about 2 hours away from the nearest grocery store and hospital, but I love getting to do research in the same place that I live and work, and the views of the Chisos Mountains from my front yard are pretty great!
Previously, I was a  a Helen Fellow at the American Museum of Natural History, working on a project to study how mesoscale eddies modulate sea-surface carbon in the Sargasso Sea. I have also served as an AmeriCorps member at the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in Santa Rosa, California, where I modeled riparian shade conditions and analyzed Trinity River flow data. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2017 with degrees in geophysics and applied mathematics. At UC Berkeley, I worked on research projects to model submarine volcanic flow fronts and study the relationship between water supply and wildfire in Yosemite. My research interests include hydrologic modeling and remote sensing.
