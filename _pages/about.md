I am currently a PhD candidate in physical oceanography in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography. I'm interested in studying biophysical interactions with a variety of tools, including observations, satellite data and models. 
<br/> <br/>
Previously, I worked as a GIS technician at Big Bend National Park in Texas, where I made maps for the park. During my time there, I developed a [set of tools](https://bigbendnp.github.io/nightskyquality/) for mapping night-sky quality, and produced a data visualization of night skies in the Big Bend region, which you can view [here](https://bigbendnp.github.io/nightskyquality/pages/nightskyviz.html). 
<br/> <br/>
I was also a Helen Fellow at the American Museum of Natural History, working on a project to study how mesoscale eddies modulate sea-surface carbon in the Sargasso Sea. Before that, I served as an AmeriCorps member at the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in Santa Rosa, California, which sparked my interest in computational science. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2017 with degrees in geophysics and applied mathematics. At UC Berkeley, I worked on research projects to model submarine volcanic flow fronts and study the relationship between water supply and wildfire in Yosemite. 
<br/> <br/>
In my free time, I bake bread, brew my own kombucha, and go on long outdoor adventures.
