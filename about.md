I am currently a Helen Fellow at the American Museum of Natural History, working on a project to visualize ocean interfaces. Previously, I served as an AmeriCorps member at the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in Santa Rosa, California, where I modeled riparian shade conditions and analyzed Trinity River flow data. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2017 with degrees in geophysics and applied mathematics. At UC Berkeley, I worked on research projects to model submarine volcanic flow fronts and study the relationship between water supply and wildfire in Yosemite. My research interests include hydrologic modeling and remote sensing.
